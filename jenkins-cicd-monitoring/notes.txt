Big Picture Motive

The goal of this code is to:

1.Provision infrastructure on AWS using Terraform

2.Launch an EC2 instance running Jenkins

3.Secure access using IAM roles, security groups, and key pairs

4.Store and monitor logs using S3 + CloudWatch

5.Expose Jenkins via a public URL

Think of it as:
“Automated Jenkins server with logging, monitoring, and basic security.”
